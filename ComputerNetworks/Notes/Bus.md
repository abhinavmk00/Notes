##### Description:

In a bus topology, all nodes are connected to a single central cable, known as the bus or backbone. Each node is connected to this central cable using a drop line and a connector.

##### Advantages:

- **Simple to Set Up:** Easy to install and configure due to its straightforward design.
- **Cost-Effective:** Requires less cable than star topology, making it cheaper to implement in smaller networks.
- **Easy to Extend:** Adding new nodes is simple and doesn't require major changes to the existing network.

##### Disadvantages:

- **Limited Scalability:** As more nodes are added, performance can degrade due to increased traffic on the bus.
- **Fault Tolerance Issues:** A failure in the central cable can bring down the entire network.
- **Troubleshooting Challenges:** Identifying and isolating faults can be difficult, as the entire network can be affected by issues with the bus.
