**Description:** Circuit Switching establishes a dedicated communication path or circuit between two nodes for the duration of the communication session. This path remains reserved for the entire duration of the call or data session, even if no data is being transmitted at certain moments.

**Key Features:**

- **Dedicated Path:** A dedicated path is set up for the entire communication session.
- **Connection-Oriented:** Requires the establishment of a connection before data transfer begins.
- **Constant Bandwidth:** Provides a constant bandwidth for the duration of the session.

**Advantages:**

- **Consistent Performance:** Since the path is dedicated, performance is consistent and predictable.
- **Low Latency:** Communication between nodes is typically fast due to the dedicated connection.
- **Guaranteed Bandwidth:** The allocated bandwidth is guaranteed for the entire session, which is beneficial for applications requiring consistent performance, such as voice calls.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Inefficient Resource Usage:** Resources are reserved for the entire duration of the session, even if no data is being sent, which can lead to inefficient use of network resources.
- **Scalability Issues:** Setting up a dedicated path for each communication can be impractical in networks with many users.
- **Setup Time:** There is often a setup time required to establish the connection before data transfer can begin.

**Examples:**

- Traditional telephone networks (PSTN)
- Older analog and digital telephony systems
