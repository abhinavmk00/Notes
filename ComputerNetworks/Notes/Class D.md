**Range**: `224.0.0.0` to `239.255.255.255`

**Purpose**: Reserved for **multicasting** (sending data to multiple hosts simultaneously). There is no subnet mask because Class D is not used for typical network and host addressing.

**Multicast Groups**: Class D addresses are used to identify multicast groups, allowing one-to-many communication.

**Example:**
- **Multicast Address**: `224.0.0.5`
    - Used by protocols like OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) for routing.
