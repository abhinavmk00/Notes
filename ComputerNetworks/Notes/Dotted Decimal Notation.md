Dotted Decimal Notation is a way of writing IP addresses in a human-readable form. It is primarily used for IPv4 addresses and consists of four decimal numbers separated by dots (periods), each representing 8 bits (or one byte) of the 32-bit IPv4 address.

An IPv4 address consists of **32 bits** divided into four **octets** (each octet is 8 bits). In **dotted decimal notation**, each octet is converted into its decimal equivalent and separated by dots.

#### Example:

Letâ€™s take an IP address in binary format:

11000000 10101000 00000001 00000001 -> 192.168.1.1

##### Importance of Dotted Decimal Notation:

- **Human-Readable**: It simplifies the representation of binary IP addresses for easier understanding and communication.
- **Network Management**: It helps in configuring network devices like routers, switches, and computers.
- **Subnetting**: Subnet masks also use dotted decimal notation, representing how many bits are used for the network portion
