- The **Host ID** represents the individual devices (computers, printers, etc.) on the network.
- It is the remaining bits of the IP address that identify a unique host within the network.
- The host ID must be unique within the same network.
##### Example:
- Continuing with **192.168.1.10/24**, the last 8 bits (**00001010**) represent the **Host ID**.
- The **Host ID** in this case is **10**, identifying the specific device on the **192.168.1.0** network.
