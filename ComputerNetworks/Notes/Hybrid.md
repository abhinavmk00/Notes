##### Description:

A hybrid topology combines two or more different topologies into a single network. For example, a network might use a star topology for individual departments but connect these star networks using a bus or ring topology.

##### Advantages:

- **Flexibility:** Can be designed to take advantage of the strengths of different topologies.
- **Scalability:** Allows for the expansion of different parts of the network according to specific needs.
- **Fault Tolerance:** Can incorporate various mechanisms for fault tolerance depending on the topologies used.

##### Disadvantages:

- **Complexity:** The combination of multiple topologies can create a complex network structure that is more difficult to manage and troubleshoot.
- **Cost:** Implementing a hybrid topology may be more expensive due to the need for diverse hardware and cabling.
- **Maintenance:** Requires careful planning and management to ensure all parts of the hybrid network work together smoothly.
