##### Function
The Physical Layer is responsible for the physical connection between devices. It deals with the transmission of raw data bits (0s and 1s) over a physical medium such as cables, radio waves, or optical fibers. It defines the hardware standards for networking devices (cables, voltage levels, signal timing, etc.).
##### Key Tasks
- Data encoding and bit synchronization.
- Physical transmission of data (e.g., electrical, optical signals).
- Handling transmission media (coaxial, fiber-optic, twisted-pair cables).
- Bit rate control (defining the number of bits sent per second).
##### Devices
Hubs, Repeaters, Network Interface Cards (NICs), Cables.
