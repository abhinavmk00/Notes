**Function**:  
The Data Link Layer ensures reliable data transfer between two devices on the same local network. It organizes data into frames and handles error detection and correction to ensure that data is not corrupted during transmission.

**Key Tasks**:
- Framing (breaking down packets into manageable frames).
- Addressing using MAC addresses (unique to each network device).
- Error detection and correction (using CRC - Cyclic Redundancy Check).
- Flow control and access control.

**Devices**:  
Switches, Bridges
