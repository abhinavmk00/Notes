**Function**:  
The Network Layer manages the routing of data across different networks. It determines the best logical path for data to travel from source to destination, even if they are on different networks.

**Key Tasks**:

- Logical addressing (IP addresses) to identify devices globally.
- Routing and forwarding of packets through routers.
- Fragmentation of data packets when they are too large for a particular network.
- Handling packet congestion and error reporting.

**Devices**:  
Routers, Layer 3 Switches.
