**Function**:  
The Transport Layer ensures end-to-end communication between two devices, maintaining reliable and error-free data transmission. It breaks data into segments, handles flow control, and performs error correction if necessary.

**Key Tasks**:
- Segmentation and reassembly of data (breaking data into smaller segments and reassembling it at the destination).
- Flow control (ensuring that a sender does not overwhelm the receiver).
- Error correction using techniques like checksums.
- Connection management: establishing, maintaining, and terminating connections between hosts.

**Protocols**:
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Provides reliable, connection-oriented communication with error-checking and flow control.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Provides faster, connectionless communication with minimal error-checking.

**Devices**:  
Firewalls, Gateways.
