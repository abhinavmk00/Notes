**Function**:  
The Session Layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating communication sessions between applications on two different devices. It ensures that data streams from different applications remain separate.

**Key Tasks**:
- Session establishment, maintenance, and termination.
- Synchronization of data exchange (checkpoints for recovery from crashes).
- Managing dialogs between devices (half-duplex or full-duplex communication).

**Protocols**:  
PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol), RPC (Remote Procedure Call).
