**Function**:  
The Presentation Layer is concerned with the translation, encryption, and compression of data. It ensures that data sent from the application layer of one system can be interpreted by the application layer of another system.

**Key Tasks**:
- Data translation between different formats (e.g., encoding, decoding of character sets like ASCII or EBCDIC).
- Data encryption and decryption for secure communication.
- Data compression to reduce the size of data for faster transmission.

**Protocols**:  
SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), TLS (Transport Layer Security), JPEG, MPEG.
