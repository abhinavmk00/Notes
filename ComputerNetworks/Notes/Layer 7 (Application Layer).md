**Function**:  
The Application Layer is the closest layer to the end user and directly interacts with software applications. It provides protocols and services that enable applications to send and receive data over the network.

**Key Tasks**:
- Providing network services directly to user applications.
- Handling application-level protocols (e.g., HTTP for web browsing, FTP for file transfer).
- Managing user authentication and resource availability.
- Ensuring that the applications can access the network and use its resources effectively.

**Protocols**:
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** for web communication.
- **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)** for file sharing.
- **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** for email services.
- **DNS (Domain Name System)** for translating domain names into IP addresses.
