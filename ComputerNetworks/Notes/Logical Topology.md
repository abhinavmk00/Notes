Logical Topology reflects arrangement of devices and their communication. It is the transmission of data over physical topology. It is independent of physical topology, irrespective of arrangements of nodes. It is concerned with intricate details of network like type of devices (switches, routers) chosen and their quality, which affect rate and speed of data packets delivery. The logical topology ensures optimal flow control that can be regulated within network. The data can either flow in a linear pattern called Logical bus or in form of a circle Logical ring.
