A MAC address table is a database maintained by a network switch that maps MAC (Media Access Control) addresses of devices to the ports on the switch where these devices are connected. The table allows the switch to make informed decisions about where to forward network frames based on the destination MAC address.

##### Advantages
**Reduced Traffic:** By forwarding frames only to the port where the destination device is connected, the switch reduces unnecessary traffic on other ports, improving network performance.
**Increased Efficiency:** The MAC address table helps in making fast and efficient forwarding decisions, reducing the amount of time it takes to deliver frames.
**Scalability:** It allows switches to handle a large number of devices on the network without significant performance degradation.
