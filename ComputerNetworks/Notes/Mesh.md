##### Description:

In a mesh topology, every node is connected to every other node in the network. This can be a full mesh (where every node is interconnected) or a partial mesh (where only some nodes are interconnected).

##### Advantages:

- **High Fault Tolerance:** Multiple paths between nodes mean that the network can continue to function even if one or more connections fail.
- **Improved Performance:** Direct connections between nodes can reduce latency and avoid congestion.
- **Scalability:** Can be expanded by adding additional nodes without significantly affecting existing connections.

##### Disadvantages:

- **Complex and Expensive:** Requires a lot of cabling and network hardware, making it more expensive and complex to set up and maintain.
- **Difficult to Install:** The complexity of connecting all nodes to each other can be challenging, particularly in large networks.
- **Maintenance Challenges:** Adding or removing nodes can be cumbersome due to the number of connections that need to be managed.
