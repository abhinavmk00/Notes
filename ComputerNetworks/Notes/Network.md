A network is a system of interconnected devices (such as computers, servers, and network equipment) that are linked together using various communication technologies to enable the exchange of data and resources. Networks can be classified based on their scope, size, and the technologies used, including local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and the Internet.
