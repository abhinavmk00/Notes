The **OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection)** is a conceptual framework used to understand and standardize the functions of a communication system or network. It divides the process of network communication into seven distinct layers, each responsible for different tasks related to data transmission between devices. This model allows different systems to communicate with each other regardless of their underlying architectures or technologies.

| 4                | [[Layer 4 (Transport Layer)\|Transport]]       | Segment(TCP), Datagram(UDP) | Reliable transmission of data segments between points on a network, including segmentation, acknowledgement, and multiplexing.                    |
| **Media layers** |                                                |                             |                                                                                                                                                   |
