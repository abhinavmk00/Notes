**Description:** Packet Switching divides data into small packets and sends each packet independently across the network. Each packet can take different paths to reach the destination, where they are reassembled into the original message. There is no dedicated path reserved for the communication session.

**Key Features:**

- **Data Division:** Data is broken into packets that are sent separately and can take different routes.
- **Connectionless:** No need to establish a dedicated connection before data transmission.
- **Dynamic Path Selection:** Packets can travel through various routes and are reassembled at the destination.

**Advantages:**

- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Network resources are used more efficiently as packets are sent as needed and can share the same network paths.
- **Scalability:** More scalable and flexible, as multiple users can share the same network resources without needing dedicated paths.
- **Robustness:** If a network path fails, packets can be rerouted through alternative paths, enhancing fault tolerance.

**Disadvantages:**

- **Variable Performance:** Performance can be variable due to the dynamic nature of packet routing and network congestion.
- **Overhead:** Additional overhead for packet headers and reassembly at the destination.
- **Latency:** Potential for increased latency and jitter, especially if packets take different routes and experience delays.

**Examples:**

- The Internet
- Local Area Networks (LANs)
- Modern digital communication systems
