Network protocols are a set of rules and conventions that dictate how data is transmitted and received across a network. They define how devices identify and communicate with each other, ensuring that data packets are properly formatted, transmitted, and interpreted.

##### Key Functions of Network Protocols
**Syntax**: Defines the structure of data exchanged between devices, including data types, composition, and sequencing. The first 8 bits represent the sender's address, the next 8 the receiver's, and the rest is the message.
**Semantics**: Sets rules for interpreting the data, ensuring the meaning and actions associated with the transmitted information are understood.
**Timing**: Coordinates data transfer, ensuring proper synchronization to prevent data loss or overflow by managing how fast and when data is sent.
**Sequence Control**: Ensures data packets are received in the correct order and handles acknowledgment and retransmission of lost data.
**Flow Control**: Manages data transmission rates, preventing data congestion by limiting the sender's output based on the receiver's readiness.
**Error Control**: Detects and corrects errors during transmission, using error detection codes and retransmission mechanisms to maintain data integrity.
**Security**: Protects data through encryption, authentication, and access control, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of communication.

##### Layers of Protocols
Protocols are categorized into layers, allowing independence between layers. This modular design ensures devices from different manufacturers can communicate.
**Example**: TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, and Ethernet.
