A **public IP address** is an address that is accessible over the Internet. These addresses are globally unique, meaning no two devices on the Internet can share the same public IP address at the same time.

**Assigned by ISPs**: Public IP addresses are assigned by **Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** and are registered with regional Internet registries (such as ARIN, RIPE, or APNIC).

**Global Reachability**: Devices with public IP addresses can be accessed from anywhere on the Internet. This is why servers hosting websites, cloud services, or other online services are assigned public IP addresses.

**Usage**: Public IP addresses are used for devices or servers that need to communicate directly with the global Internet, such as web servers, email servers, and routers.

**Example of Public IP Ranges**:
    - **1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255** (Class A)
    - **128.0.0.0 to 191.255.255.255** (Class B)
    - **192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255** (Class C)
