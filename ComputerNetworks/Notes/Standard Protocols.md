A standard protocol is a mandated protocol for all devices. It supports multiple devices and acts as a standard. Standard protocols are not vendor-specific i.e. they are not specific to a particular company or organization. 
They are developed by a group of experts from different organizations . 
These protocols are publicly available, and we need not pay for them. 
**Example** : FTP, DNS, DHCP, SMTP, TELNET, TFTP, etc
