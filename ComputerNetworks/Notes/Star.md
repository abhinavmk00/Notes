##### Description:

In a star topology, all nodes are connected to a central hub or switch. Each node has its own connection to the central device, which manages the network traffic.

##### Advantages:

- **Ease of Installation and Management:** Simple to set up and manage due to the central hub or switch.
- **Fault Isolation:** A failure in one cable or node does not affect other nodes, making troubleshooting and maintenance easier.
- **Scalability:** Additional nodes can be added easily by connecting them to the central hub or switch.

##### Disadvantages:

- **Central Point of Failure:** The central hub or switch is a single point of failure; if it fails, the entire network goes down.
- **Cost:** Requires more cabling and hardware (central hub or switch), which can be more expensive than bus topology.
- **Performance Bottlenecks:** The central hub or switch can become a bottleneck if not properly sized for the network's traffic load.
