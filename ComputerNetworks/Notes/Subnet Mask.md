A **subnet mask** is used in IP networks to define the boundaries of a subnet. It helps distinguish the network portion of an IP address from the host portion. The subnet mask is typically written in dotted decimal notation (like an IP address) and consists of a series of ones (1s) followed by a series of zeros (0s) in binary.

- Example: `255.255.255.0` is a common subnet mask, which in binary is `11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000`.
- The `1s` represent the network part, and the `0s` represent the host part.

The subnet mask helps route data efficiently by identifying the network and host parts of an IP address.
