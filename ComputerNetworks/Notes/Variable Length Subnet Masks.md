**Variable-Length Subnet Masking (VLSM)** allows for more efficient allocation of IP addresses by creating subnets of different sizes. This technique is useful when different subnets need varying numbers of host addresses.

**Advantages**:
* More flexible and efficient use of IP address space.
* Subnets can be sized according to actual needs.
 
**Disadvantages**:
* More complex to configure and manage.
* Requires careful planning and documentation.
 
**Example**: Using VLSM to divide the same Class C network 192.168.1.0/24:
    - Subnet 1: `192.168.1.0/25` (128 addresses)
    - Subnet 2: `192.168.1.128/26` (64 addresses)
    - Subnet 3: `192.168.1.192/27` (32 addresses)
