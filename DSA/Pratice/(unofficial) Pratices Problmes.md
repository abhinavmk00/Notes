1. ==A library management system needs to keep track of books and their borrowers. Each book has a unique ID, title, author, and availability status. Implement a data structure using a linked list to store book information (10 marks). Create functions to add a new book (5 marks), remove a book (5 marks), and search for a book by title (5 marks). Implement a borrowing system that updates the availability status and keeps track of the borrower's information (10 marks). Use assertions to test the functionality and deallocate all memory before exiting the program (5 marks).==
2. Design a playlist management system for a music streaming service. Use a static array to store song information including song_id, title, artist, and duration (10 marks). Implement functions to add songs to the playlist (5 marks), remove songs from the playlist (5 marks), and shuffle the playlist randomly (5 marks). Create a feature that allows users to rate songs, and implement a function to sort the playlist based on user ratings (10 marks). Use assertions to test the functionality and ensure that the array size is not exceeded (5 marks).
3. Implement a task scheduling system for a small business using a linked list. Each task has a priority level, description, assigned employee, and due date (10 marks). Create functions to add new tasks (5 marks), mark tasks as completed (5 marks), and list all tasks sorted by priority and due date (10 marks). Implement a feature that automatically assigns tasks to employees based on their current workload (5 marks). Use assertions to test the functionality and deallocate all memory before exiting the program (5 marks).
4. Design a inventory management system for a small retail store using a static array. Each product has a product_id, name, price, and quantity in stock (10 marks). Implement functions to add new products (5 marks), update product quantities when sales occur (5 marks), and generate a report of low stock items (5 marks). Create a feature that tracks the sales history of each product and calculates the most popular items (10 marks). Use assertions to test the functionality and ensure that the array size is not exceeded (5 marks).
5. Create a social media friend recommendation system using a linked list. Each user profile contains a user_id, name, and a list of interests (10 marks). Implement functions to add new users (5 marks), add connections between users (5 marks), and remove connections (5 marks). Develop an algorithm that suggests potential friends based on shared interests and mutual connections (10 marks). Use assertions to test the functionality and deallocate all memory before exiting the program (5 marks).
